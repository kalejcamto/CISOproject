# CISOproject
Developing the Cybersecurity Program

Project instructions: 
It will be given a case study of a sample organization, and be asked to prepare five managerial reports as presentations (slides and voice).
The following reports you will prepare are - for the Case organization:

 For the case organization, specify the size and composition of the cybersecurity staff, including employee titles and roles.
For the case organization, specify the structure of an effective cybersecurity risk management program, including the major phases, key milestones, and associated deliverables.

For the case organization, specify the cybersecurity policies needed, including types of policies needed and the specific policies that should be present. You will be asked to draft and present an example policy for each type.

For the case organization, specify the structure of a cybersecurity contingency planning program including major phases, key deliverables from each phase, and describe the committees that would perform these activities.

For the case organization, specify the structure of the cybersecurity governance model for the organization that is based on the ITGI approach, including the programâ€™s desired outcomes, benefits, and the responsibilities of the executive management team (as NACD essential practices) and CISO (as program designer).

The precursor courses in this specialization have provided you with the necessary background. The following parts of this project capstone course will provide more detailed specifications to prepare each report.

Your reports will be reviewed by your peers and the reviews and comments will be assessed by your course instructor.    

In these projects, you are asked to make data-driven decisions to devise plans and practices and present those efforts to a board-level audience. These presentations to the executive level should be targeted at that audience using the appropriate language and tone as well as the level of technical content and management rigor expected for a board-level presentation. You may care to take some care to develop your presentation skills before and as you prepare your work products to make sure the presentation mechanics to not hinder your ability to convey your cybersecurity understanding to your audience.
